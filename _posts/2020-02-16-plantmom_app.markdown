I just completed my second project  at Flatiron, using Sinatra, and It’s finally hitting me how much I’ve learned in just these few months.

Starting my project this time around was actually not as overwhelming as it was with my CLI project thanks to the Corneal gem. It really made the setup process pretty seamless.

I decided to create an app that allows users to log their plants. This was inspired by my own personal interest in attempting, and failing miserably, to be a successful plant mom. I had just ended the life of an orchid I was gifted about a month ago… so I guess it was just an idea that was already in my mind.

I’ve noticed that although there are already plant tracking apps on the market, most of them are mainly informational, or not very user friendly AND visually appealing.


**The MVP**

Although I have ideas to make this app with more functionality, I decided to at least get the most viable product up and running.

My app would have 2 models with the plant model having full CRUD functionality. This means that users would be able to log their plants, edit their plants, and view other users plants for inspiration and information.


**Stretch Goals**

In the future I would like to revisit this project. I think it would be really neat, and also an incentive to keep your plants alive, if users were able to have User Levels. 

For example, let's say I’m a new user and I create my account and log my first plant. I would be considered a Plant Newbie in the app. After I have x number of plants with a care level of 3 or more, that I’ve successfully kept alive, I would be able to go up a status to Plant Sista (I haven’t thoroughly thought about catchy names.. this is just an example ). Hitting this level would allow me to access more features within the app, such as getting access to the community feed within the app, or being able to see hidden pro tips. The ultimate level would be Plant Mom, with more unlocked features, like being able to leave pro tips on user's plant entries. 

I think an app with this functionality would make plant logging fun and create an incentive for being a better plantmom. 

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this project, and feel that I was able to demonstrate my knowledge on MVC setups, working with forms, connecting to databases, and basically the concepts that we’ve gone over in this module.

I was also able to dabble in CSS styling, which was fun to work with.
