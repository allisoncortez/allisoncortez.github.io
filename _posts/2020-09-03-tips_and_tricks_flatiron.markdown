Throughout all my projects at Flatiron, one thing that was always very helpful and essential was checking my code every step of the way. Through my time at Flatiron, I learned just how important your process is when creating something from the ground up. Here are some tips and tricks/steps I’ve taken when building something, that really helped when it came to debugging my own code or figuring out a fetch call.

When you first start a section:
-right away take a look at the project for that section, start brainstorming, and thinking about this while you’re going through the curriculum. You’ll be that much more prepared when the project week comes!

In regards to fetch calls:
-add a pry to your backend, to make sure you are even hitting your backend. Check your params to make sure they’re coming through correctly.
-Make use of your console.logs. Log the response you’re getting from your backend to make sure it’s what you were expecting.
-Make use of .catch. This is something I only started implementing until recently, but it definitely makes error handling that much easier.

In regards to debugging in general…
Debugger, pry, and console.logs became my best allies while working through projects. Being able to check your code every step of the way just makes everything that much more streamlined and reduces errors or any surprises that might come up in the future.

Plan ahead. 
Don’t be afraid to try new things, don’t be afraid to break code. In my experience, it was the most beneficial way to really learn and retain information, and even find new and better ways to do things.

Best of luck to everyone still going through the curriculum. I hope this was helpful!
