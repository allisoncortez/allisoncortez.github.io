Looking back at my time here at Flatiron, these are some things I wish I would have implemented more while going through each section. I’m glad to say that I’ve passed my last review and am excited to start this next step my journey as a Software Engineer. I would say this is more for people who are just starting Flatiron and maybe want a preview/general overview of things.

## PRACTICE
The curriculum does a good job of giving you the foundation, but don’t be afraid to do your own research! Get on youtube, look up documentation, see what other developers are blogging about, get involved in a community, join a slack, and don’t be afraid to reach out to your cohort leads and fellow students about questions/collaboration.

A blog I like to check out:

Also.. youtube.

## DEBUGGER IS YOUR FRIEND
Debugger, pry, and console.logs became my best allies while working through projects. Being able to check your code every step of the way just makes everything that much more streamlined and reduces errors or any surprises that might come up in the future.
