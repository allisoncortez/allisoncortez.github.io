THE MAIN IDEA
I decided to build an event app that would focus on local events, specifically art and music-themed, that were happening on that specific day. 

I started off with a basic MVP app, but quickly realized just how much I could build this out in the future. I really wanted the design to be quite simple and very user friendly. From personal experience, I feel like any time I am looking up events or want to see what’s going on in a day, I have to spend a lot of time browsing, or checking different sources. This can be somewhat tedious at times. I thought it would be really to have an event app that was simple and straightforward, an enjoyable experience, and a good resource to get quick information.

Working through this project really solidified my knowledge of the lifecycle methods we’ve been learning throughout this month. Here’s my process, from the front end and how I went about building it out:

STRETCH GOALS
Google API(adding events to your calendar)
Working with location mapping, how to get this functionality up, and running in V2.
